Used Neural Network Models to build a classifier to analyze the sentiment of reviews.
· Removed the punctuation and numbers from the data and selected a review length that 70% of the reviews have a length below it.
· Used Word Embedding to tokenize text as inputs to a deep neural network.
· Applied Multi-Layer Perceptron, One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network on training data and testing data, reported their train accuracies and test accuracies.
